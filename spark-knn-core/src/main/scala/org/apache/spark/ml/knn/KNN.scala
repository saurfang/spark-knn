/**
  * k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm
  *
  * kNN finds k closest observations in training dataset. It can be used for both classification and regression.
  * Furthermore it can also be used for other purposes such as input to clustering algorithm.
  *
  * While the brute-force approach requires no pre-training, each prediction requires going through the entire training
  * set resulting O(n log(k)) runtime per individual prediction using a heap keep track of neighbor candidates.
  * Many different implementations have been proposed such as Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), KD-Tree, Metric Tree and etc.
  * Each algorithm has its shortcomings that prevent them to be effective on large-scale and/or high-dimensional dataset.
  *
  * This is an implementation of kNN based upon distributed Hybrid Spill-Trees where training points are organized into
  * distributed binary trees. The algorithm is designed to support accurate approximate kNN search but by tuning parameters
  * an exact search can also be performed with cost of additional runtime.
  *
  * Each binary tree node is either a
  *
  * '''Metric Node''':
  * Metric Node partition points exclusively into two children by finding two pivot points and divide by middle plane.
  * When searched, the child whose pivot is closer to query vector is searched first. Back tracking is required to
  * ensure accuracy in this case, where the other child should be searched if it can possibly contain better neighbor
  * based upon candidates picked during previous search.
  *
  * '''Spill Node''':
  * Spill Node also partitions points into two children however there are an overlapping buffer between the two pivot
  * points. The larger the buffer size, the less effective the node eliminates points thus could increase tree height.
  * When searched, defeatist search is used where only one child is searched and no back tracking happens in this
  * process. Because of the buffer between two children, we are likely to end up with good enough candidates without
  * searching the other part of the tree.
  *
  * While Spill Node promises O(h) runtime where h is the tree height, the tree is deeper than Metric Tree's O(log n)
  * height on average. Furthermore, when it comes down to leaves where points are more closer to each other, the static
  * buffer size means more points will end up in the buffer. Therefore a Balance Threshold (rho) is introduced: when
  * either child of Spill Node makes up more than rho fraction of the total points at this level, Spill Node is reverted
  * back to a Metric Node.
  *
  * A high level overview of the algorithm is as follows:
  *
  *  1. Sample M data points (M is relatively small and can be held in driver)
  *  1. Build the top level metric tree
  *  1. Repartition RDD by assigning each point to leaf node of the above tree
  *  1. Build a hybrid spill tree at each partition
  *
  * This concludes the training phase of kNN.
  * See [[KNNModel]] for details on prediction phase.
  *
  *
  * This algorithm is described in [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WACV.2007.18]] where it was shown to scale well in terms of
  * number of observations and dimensions, bounded by the available memory across clusters (billions in paper's example).
  * This implementation adapts the MapReduce algorithm to work with Spark.
